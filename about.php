            <h1>Vision</h1>
            <p>There is a group of people and organization who are intensifying the sores of Bangladesh by different ways to sustain their own interest. Though they shout “Man for man, Life for life”, but they believe in filling up own pocket showing the country’s canker which is otherwise created by them indeed. They are busy with serving for themselves, not for God. But if anybody wants to consecrate himself, the best way is to serve for the humanity. And to get beatitude one must satisfy God. From this realization few like-minded students of Different Universities take the initiative to establish The KANDARI SOCIAL WELFARE SOCIETY with a motto “ A Step Towards Humanity”</p>

        <h2 style="padding: 6% 12%;">Beware My Captain</h2>
        <p style="padding: 0% 12%;">You have to cross the darkness of the night A desert vast and a hill of great height, And an ocean, fathomless and dark. Travellers, beware and look sharp. The boat is trembling, The water is swelling, The sail is torn asunder, And the boatman is losing his way, Who will sit at the helm at this hour? Who has the courage and the power? The future calls your, Come forward, all who are bold and true. The night is dark, the storm is great, You must look sharp, there is no time to hesitate. You must make haste or it would be too late To ferry the boat across the other side. The night is dark, Be your own guard. your, soldiers of the country, Age old grievances have declared a fight, The deprived heart is demanding its right. You must take them along, the poor and the weak, You must make them strong, no longer mild and meek You must lead them to victory. O Captain, my captain, The helpless nation is going under water, It does not know how to swim. I shall watch tonight Your determination, grim yet bright, To free the country from slavery. 'Are they Hindus or Muslims?' Who ask this question, I say. Tell him, my Captain, The children of the motherland are drowning today. Doubts assail the mind of the travelers still, There is thunder in the sky and danger over the hill. Captain, will you lose the way And leave us in the lurch? You must not waver or sway, You must carry on the march. Those who sang the victory of life With the nose of the gallows round their neck Come and gather round quietly today. What price do you pay for that, friends, What sacrifice do you make? It is a test, dear Captain, Do you save the country or the cast at this hour? The boat is trembling, The water is swelling, Beware, my Captain, beware</p>
