                Ten reasons why it is important to care for our elders.<br/><br/>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Because they are our mothers and fathers. They are our first
                    teachers. They teach how to love, how to care, how to give, how to forgive,
                    how to accept, and most of all they are our backbone of support. Without their
                    endless sacrifice during our early years, we wouldn’t be capable of what we are
                    today. We need to care for our elders because they deserve to be cared for.
                    Respect and care for our elders starts with our parents, our first Gurus.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Wisdom. Our elders have more knowledge and wisdom than any one of us.
                    Their experiences through the turbulence of storms that life takes them through
                    yield great wisdom. They’ve come so far and they’ve learned so much, we have
                    a responsibility to learn from that wisdom. So take the time to listen to what
                    they have to say.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Morals, values, principles. Our elders have either acquired, created or have
                    been brought up with a set of morals, values and/or principles in their life. They
                    may not apply to our own but the least we can do is see how those values
                    impacted their lives. We can learn a thing or two from adopting those values.
                    Learn the right and wrong. Have the insight into a set of rules that we can
                    outline for ourselves to follow and live by. Our elders would want the best for
                    us and they would be more than willing to tell us what set of rules and
                    guidelines have made them successful and hopefully, peaceful.
                </li>
                <li>
                    They love us. Unconditionally. No matter what you do in life, who you
                    become, where you live, who you are with —our elders will always love us
                    unconditionally. Sure they might be disappointed in you or be upset with you
                    from time to time but at the end of the day you are still their kiddo. This kind of
                    unconditional love is hard to find anywhere else in this universe. The mere
                    presence of our elders gives us hope and strength to keep calm and carry on.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Sacrifice. They worked their butt off for you, that’s why. Once we, as
                    children, come into the picture our elders sacrifice much of their life to see to it
                    that we are well and happy. They make sure to provide us with all the comforts.
                    They sacrifice their own likes to see a smile on our faces. They look to us in
                    times of failure or success to remind themselves what they are fighting for
                    everyday.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Experience. No matter what, your elders have years on you. For this simple
                    reason, we must appreciate them. We may or may not know of all the ups and
                    downs they’ve faced in life but they’ve definitely gained experience that is
                    worth respecting and learning from. Our elders may hide much pain from us
                    because they don’t want us to feel the pain, the least we can do is appreciate
                    them for all that they’ve gone through—gained and lost—and learn from their
                    insight into situations and circumstances.

                    History and heritage. Both my grandparents lived under the British Rule of
                    India. They preserved the importance of being a Brahmin—a Vedic scholar
                    within the family and community. The traditions, rituals, languages, new
                    clothes for every festival, food, wedding festivities etc., are unique to that
                    heritage. This heritage and history brings a sense of belongingness. Most
                    importantly, it brings us a sense of identity of our past and the responsibility we
                    have to stay true to our origins for future generations. This heritage and history
                    is best preserved through our elders. We have much to learn from them with
                    regards to our heritage, to be proud of our past.

                    They are nearing their end and their future is uncertain. Put yourself in the
                    shoes of an elderly person. When you know you are becoming fragile and your
                    body is failing you, it’s difficult to cope with the uncertainty of the
                    future—mentally and physically. Our elders may have many things on their
                    mind but they may not be able to express them. Our responsibility comes in to
                    give them the support they need to help them live the rest of their lives
                    peacefully. No one wants their last days to be filled with regret and
                    disappointment. So take charge of being that love and light, be with them in
                    their last days.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Because we are human beings and because it is the right thing to
                    do. Humanity plays a crucial role in taking care of our elders. After all, we’re
                    going to be elderly people some day too. The truth is we need our elders and we
                    cannot live without them. There comes a day when they can’t live without us.
                    They need our support just as much as they gave us theirs when we didn’t even
                    ask for it. This brings out the humanity within us. This expression of humanity
                    makes us human. When we act to care for our elders, our children will see that
                    with respect and will act to care for us someday…at least we can hope they
                    will.

            So if you have some free time:
            Go volunteer at a old-age home.
            Re-connect with your grand parents. Give them some room in your day.
            Talk to your uncles and aunts, see how they are doing.
            If you have elders at home, listen to them. Talk to them. Spend some quality time
            with them. They would be more than happy.
            Help an elderly man or a woman on the street. Say hi to them or simply smile at
            them with respect.
            You’d be glad you did, I promise.
